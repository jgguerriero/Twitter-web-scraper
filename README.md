# Twitter-web-scraper
## Basic web scraper to get tweet and user info for a given search. 

The web scraper is functional as of 2024-02-28. It will likely need to be updated over time to reflect changes in Twitter's web layout or edge cases that I didn't originally consider.

The web scraper is designed to achieve the following...
  (1) allow a user to query Twitter using search terms, returning all tweets that are related to the search term
  (2) extract tweet content for returned tweets
  (3) go to the tweeting users page and extract profile-level info (total posts, number of followers)
