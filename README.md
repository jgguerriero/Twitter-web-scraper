# X(FKA Twitter)-web-scraper
## Basic web scraper to extract tweet (i.e., post) and user info for a given search. 

The web scraper is functional as of 2024-02-28. It will likely need to be updated over time to reflect changes in X's web layout or edge cases not originally considered.

Generally, the web scraper is designed to

(1) query posts using search terms

(2) extract post content 

(3) extract profile-level info for those who posted (total posts, number of followers)

The scraper is built with the Selenium library for Python and [chromedriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
